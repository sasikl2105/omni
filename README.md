# Omni

Omni is a modular, ethical, JARVIS-inspired assistant designed to run on low-end devices first (Android via Termux), scale to laptops later, and optionally integrate with system-level access on rooted devices — always with explicit user permission.

Features:
- Persistent memory
- Ethical hacking assistant (education only)
- Game development assistant (Glitchwood)
- Permission-based system access

No malware. No exploits. Educational & ethical only.
